# Changelog

All notable changes to Karakos are recorded here, in
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format. This project
follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> **Note on historical tags.** Releases before `v1.5.0` used two tag forms —
> `vX.Y` and `vX.Y.Z` — and `v1.1` was created *after* `v1.1.1`, so the tag
> order does not match the history. Those tags are left as they are, because
> rewriting published tags breaks anyone pinned to them. From `v1.5.0`
> onward, every release is a three-part `vX.Y.Z`. Entries below `v1.4.1` are
> reconstructed from commit history and are less granular than entries going
> forward will be.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `session` tool `load_last` now returns an explicit error when no agent identity is available (`KARAKOS_AGENT` unset and no `agent` argument) and rejects path-like agent names, instead of guessing (Fixes #160, "session tool: load_last can return another agent's summary").
- `bin/purge-data.py` derives the agent for session-summary retention by stripping the trailing timestamp, so hyphenated agent names such as `test-agent` get their own budget (Refs #156, "purge-data: hyphenated agent names share one session-summary budget"; the VACUUM-count part is not addressed here).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-10-03

2.0 is a new runtime under the same install: an agent registry, shards and a hive, graph memory, a
Discord outbox, steering, a build queue, and a migrator that upgrades a 1.x install in place.
Upgrade with `bin/karakos migrate` ([docs/UPGRADING.md](docs/UPGRADING.md)); it backs up first and
`karakos migrate --restore <backup>` goes back.

Verified for this release: CI unit suite, fresh-install and Docker smokes, and container upgrades
from v1.3 and v1.5.0 with restore. The real-CLI smoke (`pytest tests -q -m "slow and realcli"`)
passed against the real `claude` CLI on the release commit. Upgrades from v1.0.0 and v1.1.1 are not
container-tested (those tags cannot build their own images); the migrator detects and migrates
their layout, covered by unit fixtures. The Windows installer is unchanged from 1.5.

- Fixed: a respawned agent (reload, interrupt, crash recovery) restarted its existing session with
  `--session-id`, which the real CLI refuses ("Session ID is already in use"); it now uses
  `--resume`. A turn whose CLI died before answering is recorded as crashed, not as complete with
  an empty reply, and a message sent while an agent is restarting waits for the new process or
  returns to the queue, so neither is dropped silently.
- Fixed: `karakos migrate --restore` failed with EPERM copying file times onto files the container
  user does not own, and did not remove files the failed run had created.
- The release gate no longer requires a `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret: without it the real-CLI
  smoke skips with a notice.

- Documentation for 2.0 (ANDURIL 7.2): UPGRADING rewritten around `bin/karakos migrate` with a drain checklist, ARCHITECTURE restructured for the registry, shards, hive, graph memory, outbox and credentials, new EXTENDING sections (shards, hive, memory, prompts, build queue, upgrade seams, native-deployment lessons), a QUICKSTART with smoke-tagged check commands, `docs/TEST_RESULTS.md` marked historical, and `tests/test_docs.py` to keep them honest.

- Operator switches (ANDURIL 6.4): `/pause [minutes]` holds an agent's queue (the turn in progress finishes; `data/operator-pause.json`, survives restarts; `POST /agents/{name}/pause|resume`), `/resume`, `/effort <level>` (agent-level `--effort` override in `data/runtime-overrides.json`, applied after the turn when busy; `POST /agents/{name}/effort`), and `/interrupt` with an optional `message`. `GET /agents` shards gain `effort`/`effort_source`. A registry `effort:` key, previously inert, is now passed to the CLI as `--effort`.
- Turn logs are redacted: the stream-log tee, `turn_events` rows and tool lines mask credential-shaped strings and the values of secret-named environment variables (`lib/redact.py`). Existing logs are not rewritten (ANDURIL 6.4).

- Removed the unused Go installer source (`installer/`); `install.sh` and `install.ps1` are the install paths.

- The package image builds `karakos-dashboard` at the commit pinned in `dashboard.ref` (`KARAKOS_PROFILE=package`) instead of shipping its own `dashboard/` tree, which is deleted. Node is one pinned major (`NODE_MAJOR`) for both stages. Releases attach a pruned dashboard build bundle (no source). `bin/fetch-dashboard.sh`, `bin/build-dashboard-bundle.sh`, `bin/dashboard-stage.sh` (ANDURIL 5.3).

- The dashboard source is `dashboard/` in this repo again (ANDURIL 5.3b), the package-relevant part of the 2.0 dashboard with its tests; the image builds it with `npm ci` and `next build`. The pinned-ref fetch, source tarball and release bundle (`dashboard.ref`, `bin/fetch-dashboard.sh`, `bin/build-dashboard-bundle.sh`, `bin/dashboard-stage.sh`) and the `DASHBOARD_FETCH_TOKEN` secret are removed; CI and releases need no secret.

- Rate-limit breaker (account-wide, `rate_limit_state` re-keyed by window type via migrator step `35_rate_limit`), per-agent `token_budget_4h` with a 30-minute minimum pause, and a weekly-usage governor for machine-started work (`config/governor.yaml`). `GET /usage` and `GET /agents` gain additive fields (ANDURIL 2.7).

- Build queue (off by default, `config/build-queue.yaml`): `bin/buildq`, per-host concurrency, an admission probe, remote exec hosts over ssh, cancel with salvage, and an outcome check that fails a build with no PR (`lib/buildq.py`, `lib/build_dispatcher.py`; migrator step `50_build_queue`; ANDURIL 3.3).

### Added

- Safety hooks (`bash-safety-rails.py`, `block-bare-ssh.py`, opt-in `block-heavy-build.py`) wired by `bin/hooks-sync.py` from `config/hooks.json`, and a secrets pre-commit (`system/check-secrets.py`). Removed the `rewrite-sleep-poll.py` hook (`bin/wait-for.sh` stays).
- `agent-server.py`: load stored facts from `memory.db` (and candidate facts from `data/memory-candidates/`) and routing-table `MEMORY.md` into `--append-system-prompt` at startup and session resume, closing the durable memory retrieval loop.

### Fixed

- Memory maintenance: episodes created in the nightly pass were pruned in
  the same run before a grace period could apply, a scoring failure
  defaulted to a below-cutoff score, and decay compounded across nightly
  runs instead of applying idempotently. Added `MEMORY_PRUNE_GRACE_DAYS`
  (default 7), a scoring retry, and a `base_importance` column that decay
  is now computed from.
- `memory` MCP tool: added a `remember` action, the first live write path
  into the `facts` table.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-09-23
