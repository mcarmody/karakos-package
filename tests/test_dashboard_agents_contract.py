"""
Tests for the shape contract on /api/agents in the dashboard.

The case this exists for: `dashboard/app/api/agents/route.ts` reshapes
agent-server data into `{ agents: [...] }` — an ARRAY of `{name, state, ...}`
objects (originally sourced from a `/status` endpoint agent-server.py never
actually registered; it now merges the real `/health` and `/agents` routes —
see the route's own comment). `dashboard/app/chat/page.tsx` typed that as
`Record<string, {state}>` and read it with `Object.keys(agentData.agents)`.

`Object.keys()` on an array returns its indices: "0", "1", "2". So the agent
dropdown populated with the strings "0", "1", "2" and was fully selectable —
it looked right. Picking one then sent `agent: "0"` to the backend and built
URLs like `/api/agents/0/reload`. Silently wrong beats visibly broken only for
whoever is not debugging it.

TypeScript could not catch this: the interface asserted a shape the route never
returns, and an assertion is not a check. These tests read the source the way
TestNextjsRouteExports does — the route is the authority on the shape, and the
consumers have to agree with it.
