ERROR: Karakos cannot write to its own storage: ${unwritable[*]}

These are Docker volumes left over from an earlier install, and they are owned
by root instead of the container user (uid $(id -u)). Karakos will not start
until they are replaced.

Fix it by deleting the old volumes and starting again. From the config/
directory of your Karakos install:

    docker compose down -v
    docker compose up -d

This erases the message archive and logs in those volumes. Your agents and
configuration live on the host and are not affected.
