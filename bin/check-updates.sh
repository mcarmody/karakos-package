#!/usr/bin/env bash
# check-updates.sh — weekly check for a newer Karakos release.
#
# Scheduled Mondays 05:00 by bin/scheduler.py. Two things it has to get right,
# and it used to get both wrong (#152).
#
# **What version is this install running?** The image tag, and nothing else.
# config/docker-compose.yml resolves
# `ghcr.io/mcarmody/karakos:${KARAKOS_VERSION:-latest}`, and `env_file: .env`
# puts that same KARAKOS_VERSION inside the container — so reading it here,
# defaulting to `latest` exactly as compose does, is the one answer that cannot
# disagree with the code actually running. Every other candidate was checked
# and is wrong:
#
#   - `$WORKSPACE_ROOT/package.json` — what this script used to read. There is
#     no package.json at the workspace root; the only one is
#     dashboard/package.json. Under `set -e` the `cat` killed the script on its
#     tenth line, so the weekly check had never completed a single run.
#   - `.karakos/config.json` — setup.sh writes `"version": "1.0.0"` as a string
#     literal, on every install, of every release, and never rewrites it on
#     upgrade. It stamps the config schema, not the release.
#   - `dashboard/package.json` — also a frozen "1.0.0", and it versions the
#     Next.js app rather than the release.
#   - a git tag — .dockerignore excludes .git and bin/entrypoint.sh runs a
#     fresh `git init` in /workspace, so a deployed install has no tags at all.
#
# **Who hears about it?** bin/poke.sh, to the primary agent, replying in
# #signals — deliberately NOT the direct-to-Discord path that
# bin/cli-upgrade-watchdog.sh takes. That script bypasses the agent queue
# because the thing it reports is that agents cannot complete a turn, so a
# queued notice would land in the one place nobody can read it. An available
# update is not an outage: agents are answering normally, and an agent can do
# something with this that a raw webhook post cannot — read the release notes,
# say what actually changed, and be asked "should we?" in the same thread. If
# the agent server happens to be down, poke.sh spools the message and
# bin/flush-deferred-messages.py re-fires it, so the notice is not lost either.
#
# **The `latest` case.** On a default install KARAKOS_VERSION is unset, the
# running tag is literally `latest`, and there is no version number to compare.
# Comparing the string "latest" to "v1.4" is not a comparison. What is true and
# worth saying is that a release exists and that `latest` only moves when the
# image is pulled — so the notice reports the release and the pull command, and
# a state file keeps it to once per release rather than every Monday forever.
#
# **Pinning to a minor tag is not being behind.** .github/workflows/release.yml
# publishes a v1.3.1 build as `v1.3` and `v1` as well, so KARAKOS_VERSION=v1.3
# already carries the newest 1.3.x. Comparison is therefore done at the
# precision the operator actually pinned.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  the check completed — up to date, pinned ahead, or an update announced
#   1  the check could not complete — the releases API was unreachable or
#      unreadable, or an available update could not be announced. Nobody is
#      paged for that (a network blip is not news); bin/scheduler.py logs it,
#      which is what keeps a permanently broken checker from going quiet for
#      another month.
