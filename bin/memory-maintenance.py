"""
Memory Maintenance — Episodic consolidation and embedding generation.

Processes recent messages from JSONL files:
1. Reads previous day's messages from JSONL
2. Scores importance (using Claude Haiku for cheap importance scoring)
3. Creates episodes in SQLite episodes table
4. Decays existing episode scores (configurable decay rate)
5. Applies cutoff to prune low-importance episodes

Called by scheduler daily at 3 AM.

    only right after the `ALTER TABLE` — so a row written some other way

    migration) never sits with a NULL that would otherwise make it either
    un-prunable forever (`inserted_at`) or double-decay (`base_importance`

    `base_importance` is the score `decay_importance()` subtracts age
    from — without it, decay was applied to the already-decayed
    `importance` column every night, so loss compounded quadratically
    instead of growing linearly with age. Backfilled from the current
    `importance` so existing rows don't jump on the next run; this does
    mean a pre-existing row's already-decayed value becomes its new
    `base_importance`, i.e. one extra round of decay gets baked in at
    migration time, and then ages normally from there.

    `inserted_at` records when the row was written to the DB, as opposed
    to `created_at` (the source message's own timestamp, still used for
    recall ranking — see mcp/tools-server.py). It is what the prune grace
    period measures against, so a backfilled default of "now" is
    deliberately conservative: it protects pre-existing rows for a full
