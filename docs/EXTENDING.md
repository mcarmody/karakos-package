# Extending Karakos

Guide to customizing agents, adding skills, and growing the system.

## Adding a New Agent

```bash
# Inside the container
bin/create-agent.sh --template primary --model sonnet oracle

# With a Discord bot identity
bin/create-agent.sh --template builder --model sonnet \
  --discord-token "$DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_BUILDER" builder
```

Templates: `primary`, `relay`, `builder`, `reviewer`.

The agent is hot-registered — no server restart needed.

`create-agent.sh` also drops `agents/<name>/onboarding.md` into every new
agent. The agent server injects it as the first turn's prompt **whenever
`persona/` is empty**, so a brand-new agent interviews you about who you are
instead of starting from nothing. Writing your first `persona/` file is
therefore also what switches onboarding off.

## Customizing Agent Personality

Each agent has a persona directory:

```
agents/{name}/
├── SYSTEM_PROMPT.md    # Core instructions (generated from template)
├── onboarding.md       # First-turn prompt, used only while persona/ is empty
├── persona/
│   └── voice.md        # Voice, tone, behavioral rules
├── inbox/              # Incoming work briefs
└── journal/            # Agent-written logs
```

Edit `persona/voice.md` to customize how the agent communicates. This file is loaded fresh on each session start — no restart needed.

### Example voice.md

```markdown
# Voice

## Tone
Direct and concise. No filler words. Technical when appropriate.

## Addressing Style
Call the owner by first name.

## Boundaries
Never discuss politics or religion. Redirect to practical topics.
```

### Prompt composition and migrated agents

Migrated agents keep their own prompt verbatim (`prompt: {core: false, house_style: false}`); turn `core`/`house_style` on after removing the duplicated sections from the prompt file by hand.

## Adding a Skill

Skills add new tools to the MCP server. They're automatically discovered at startup.

**This is not Claude Code's built-in Agent Skills feature.** Claude Code has
its own native skill system: a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter,
auto-discovered from `.claude/skills/`. Karakos "skills" are a separate,
package-specific convention — a `tools.json` schema plus a `scripts/`
implementation, discovered by `mcp/tools-server.py` and exposed as MCP
tools. A frontmatter-only `SKILL.md` dropped under `skills/` will not load
here; it needs `tools.json` and `scripts/` as shown below.

### 1. Create the Skill Directory

```bash
cp -r skills/hello-world skills/my-skill
```

### 2. Define Tools

Edit `skills/my-skill/tools.json`:

```json
{
  "skill_name": "my-skill",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "What this skill does",
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "my_tool",
      "description": "What this tool does",
      "inputSchema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "query": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Search query"
          }
        },
        "required": ["query"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Implement

Create `skills/my-skill/scripts/my_tool.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json, os

args = json.loads(os.environ.get("TOOL_ARGS", "{}"))
query = args.get("query", "")

# Do something useful
result = {"answer": f"You asked about: {query}"}

print(json.dumps(result))
```

Scripts receive `TOOL_ARGS` (JSON) and `WORKSPACE_ROOT` via environment. Print
JSON to stdout. Exit code 0 = success.

Three details the discovery code enforces and it is cheap to get wrong:

- **The script filename must match the tool name.** `my_tool` looks for
  `scripts/my_tool.py`, then `scripts/my_tool.sh`, falling back to
  `scripts/main.py` or `scripts/main.sh`. Nothing else is tried.
- **The working directory is the skill directory**, not the workspace root.
  Use `WORKSPACE_ROOT` for anything outside your own skill.
- **60 seconds, hard.** A tool that runs longer is killed and reported as a
  failure.

`skills/README.md` is the fuller authoring guide, including argument
validation and error conventions.

### 4. Test

```bash
python3 mcp/tools-server.py --test-tool my_tool '{"query": "test"}'
```

### 5. Activate

Reset the agent session (dashboard → Agents → Reset, or via API). The MCP server restarts with the agent and discovers the new skill.

## Writing a harness test

`tests/harness/` runs the real `bin/agent-server.py` against a fake `claude`
binary that speaks stream-json, so a test exercises the real spawn path, argv,
queue, cost rows and result parsing with no API spend. CI has no
pytest-asyncio; drive it with `asyncio.run`.

```python
def test_reply(harness):
    h = harness(agents=["a", "b"])          # or Harness(tmp_workspace, agents={"a": {"model": "x"}})

    async def scenario():
        async with h:
            h.script(default={"text": "pong: {{text}}"},
                     rules=[{"match": "slow", "step": {"delay_ms": 300}}])
            await h.send("a", "ping", channel_id="1")
            await h.wait_idle("a", timeout=5)

    asyncio.run(scenario())
    assert h.queue_rows("a")[0]["response"].startswith("pong:")
    assert h.discord[-1]["content"].startswith("pong:")   # post_to_discord is stubbed
```

A step is `{text, tools: [{name, input, usage, message_id, parent_tool_use_id}],
usage, cost, delay_ms, is_error, exit, hang}`; `{{text}}` echoes the input and
`{{env:KARAKOS_AGENT}}` names the agent. `exit` kills the fake mid-turn (respawn
watcher), `hang` stops it reading (pair with `h.interrupt`). Readers
(`h.sent_to`, `h.argv`, `h.queue_rows`, `h.stream_events`) take a shard id,
which equals the agent id until the registry has shards; `h.cost_rows()` is
global. Tests must not read `HOME`, bind real ports or touch Discord;
`tests/test_no_home_access.py` enforces this. The `Harness` signatures are
frozen by `tests/test_harness_api.py`.

**Known load flakes.** Under full-suite load a few harness tests have timed out
and then passed alone or on rerun: `test_depth_cap_two_for_calls` and
`test_two_shards_calling_each_other_is_refused_at_once` (hive timeouts, in
`tests/test_hive_harness.py`) and `test_no_boundary_runs_as_next_turn` (a
`wait_for` in `tests/test_steering_harness.py`). They are timing sensitivity, not
logic failures: rerun the test alone before treating one as a regression, and
give a new harness wait a generous timeout.

## Using the Builder Agent

The builder agent receives specs as markdown files in its inbox and implements them on feature branches.

### Writing a Spec

Create a file in **`inbox/builder/`** at the workspace root. This is not
`agents/builder/inbox/` — the dispatcher only watches the top-level `inbox/`.

```markdown
---
target_branch: main
repo: mcarmody/karakos-package
branch_prefix: builder
requester: 123456789012345678
callback_channel: general
---

# Feature: User Preferences

## Summary
Add a user preferences system that persists settings to a JSON file.

## Requirements
1. Create `data/preferences.json` with default values
2. Add `preferences` tool to MCP server (get/set actions)
3. Primary agent can read and update preferences

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Preferences persist across restarts
- [ ] Default values provided for new installations
```

Only five frontmatter keys are read: `target_branch`, `repo`,
`branch_prefix`, `requester` and `callback_channel`. Anything else is ignored.

**`requester` is the one that matters most.** It is the Discord user ID the
completion notice is sent to. Without it, the build runs to completion and
nobody is told — there is no fallback announcement.

### Triggering a Build

The dispatch adapter watches `inbox/<agent>/`. When it finds a spec:

1. It invokes `bin/invoke-builder.sh` with the spec path
2. The builder reads the spec, creates a feature branch, implements, opens a PR
3. Cost is recorded against the builder agent through the agent server's
   `/cost` endpoint — it is visible on the dashboard's `/costs` page, and it is
   **not** posted to the signals channel
4. `requester` is poked on `callback_channel` (default `general`)
5. Owner reviews and merges

Concurrency is capped: one builder and two reviewers at a time
(`MAX_CONCURRENT_BUILDERS`, `MAX_CONCURRENT_REVIEWERS`). A builder dispatch
times out after 6 hours, a reviewer after 1.

### Using the Reviewer Agent

Send a spec and codebase for adversarial review:

```bash
bin/invoke-reviewer.sh inbox/builder/my-feature.md
```

The spec path is positional. The flags it accepts are `--model`,
`--dispatch-id`, `--output-format`, `--codebase-review` and `--help`; there is
no `--spec`, `--branch` or `--mode`, and passing one silently swallows it as
the spec path instead.

The reviewer returns one of three verdicts: **APPROVE**, **REVISE** or
**RETHINK**.

## Inter-Agent Communication

Agents communicate via `bin/poke.sh`:

`poke.sh` takes **flags**, not positional agent and channel names. Bare words
before the message are silently discarded and the poke goes to the default
agent on the default channel, which is a quiet way to lose a message.

```bash
bin/poke.sh --agent primary --reply-channel general "Status report please"

# Queue it without any Discord post at all (channel_id "0")
bin/poke.sh --agent primary --silent "run the nightly sweep"
```

For file-based dispatch, drop files in `inbox/{agent-name}/`.

### Routing

The relay sends each Discord message to a shard (`lib/routing.py`), in this order:

1. A channel that is not in `channels.json` is never routed, mention or not.
2. An `@mention` of a known agent goes to the shard that owns the channel if it belongs to that agent, else to that agent's first shard.
3. A bot never routes on a channel default (it must `@mention`).
4. Otherwise the shard that lists the channel in `agents.yaml` gets it.
5. A listed channel no shard owns goes to the primary agent's first shard.
6. Otherwise nothing is routed.

Set `"route": false` on a channel in `channels.json` to switch off rule 5 for it (rules 2 and 4 still apply). The relay re-reads `agents.yaml` and `channels.json` when they change, so a shard added by `/reload` needs no relay restart.

## Self-Modification

The system can modify itself through the builder agent:

1. Write a spec describing the change
2. Builder implements on a feature branch
3. Reviewer provides adversarial feedback
4. Owner merges the PR
5. `config/protected-paths.json` decides what the builder may touch

That file has three lists, not one. **Tier 1** is a hard block — `system/`,
`config/`, `.karakos/`, `Dockerfile`, and the four `bin/` scripts that own
process lifecycle. **Tier 2** requires review: the rest of `bin/`,
`agents/templates/`, `mcp/tools-server.py`. **Overrides** are always writable
even though they sit under a protected prefix: `agents/*/persona/`,
`agents/*/journal/`, `agents/*/inbox/` — which is what lets an agent maintain
its own persona and journal without being handed its own process lifecycle.

### What Requires Restart

| Changed File | Restart Needed | How |
|-------------|---------------|-----|
| `persona/voice.md` | None | Loaded fresh each session |
| `skills/*/` | Agent session reset | Dashboard → Reset |
| `config/agents.yaml`, adding an agent | None | `bin/create-agent.sh` hot-registers via POST `/agents/{name}/register` |
| `config/agents.yaml`, changing an existing agent | Agent respawn | POST `/agents/{name}/reload` (keeps context) or `/reset` (drops it) |
| `bin/agent-server.py` | Container restart | `make down && make up` |
| `Dockerfile` | Container rebuild | see [Local development build](#local-development-build) |

## Local Development Build

Production installs pull a prebuilt image from GHCR (`make pull`).
If you are modifying the `Dockerfile` or Python/Node dependencies and need to
test those changes before a release, use the dev compose override:

```bash
docker compose \
  -f config/docker-compose.yml \
  -f config/docker-compose.dev.yml \
  --env-file config/.env \
  up --build -d
```

`config/docker-compose.dev.yml` overlays `build: .` back onto the service so
your local changes are compiled into an image named `karakos-dev:local`.
Bring the stack back down and return to the prebuilt image at any time with:

```bash
docker compose -f config/docker-compose.yml --env-file config/.env down
make up
```

The dev override is intentionally not committed to production flows — it is
only for contributors iterating on the image itself.

## Dashboard build

The dashboard source is `dashboard/` in this repo: a Next.js app with its own
`package.json` and `package-lock.json`. Nothing is fetched, pinned or
vendored; changing the dashboard is an ordinary PR to these files.

- **Develop:** `cd dashboard && npm ci && npm test && npm run build`. See
  [`dashboard/README.md`](../dashboard/README.md) for the environment it reads.
- **Image:** the `dashboard-build` stage of the `Dockerfile` runs `npm ci` and
  `next build` on `dashboard/`, prunes dev dependencies and keeps `.next`,
  `node_modules`, `public`, `package.json` and `next.config.mjs`; the runtime
  stage copies those to `/workspace/dashboard`. Node is one `NODE_MAJOR` for the
  build stage and the runtime image so the native modules (`better-sqlite3`,
  `sqlite3`) built in the first load in the second, and the stage fails if
  they do not load or a source map is left in the output.
- **CI:** the `dashboard` job runs `npm ci`, `npm test` and `npm run build`; the
  `docker-smoke` job builds the image and checks `/login` answers 200, a route
  the dashboard does not have answers 404 once logged in, and `/api/agents`
  answers 401 without a session. Neither job needs a secret.
- **To run a modified dashboard:** edit `dashboard/` and rebuild the image
  (`docker compose -f config/docker-compose.yml -f config/docker-compose.dev.yml build`).

## Configuration

`config/.env` holds the environment, but it is not the whole story — four
other files in `config/` carry configuration the wizard generates and you may
want to edit:

| File | Holds |
|---|---|
| `.env` | Secrets, ports, limits — everything below |
| `agents.yaml` | The agent registry: model, `max_turns`, timeout, streaming flags |
| `channels.json` | Which Discord servers and channels are watched, and each channel's `default_agent`, `reply_gate` and `guest_agents` |
| `claude-settings.json` | Hook wiring and the tool permission policy |
| `protected-paths.json` | What a builder agent may and may not commit |

### Environment variables

## Claude Code Hooks

`config/claude-settings.json` is a package-owned Claude Code settings file
passed via `--settings` on every agent's `claude` spawn line
(`bin/agent-server.py`), rather than a `.claude/` directory an installer
would have to scaffold and a user could delete. It wires hook events and
carries the tool permission policy. Shipped hooks:

| Event | Script | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `system/hooks/log-user-prompt.sh` | Appends one line to `logs/hook-events.log` per prompt — proves the hook pipeline is live. |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `system/hooks/inject-recall.py` | Re-injects a recall block before every user message (see below). |
| `PreToolUse` (`Edit\|Write\|MultiEdit\|Read`) | `system/hooks/resolve-symlink-edit.py` | Rewrites a path through a symlink to its realpath so the harness's "refusing to write through symlink" rejection never reaches the model. |
| `PreToolUse` (`Bash`) | `system/hooks/bash-safety-rails.py` | Denies `pkill -f`, prisma `--accept-data-loss`, `rm -r` on `/`, `$HOME`, the workspace or `.git`, and force-pushes to main/master. Logs denies to `logs/blocked-bash.jsonl`. |
| `PreToolUse` (`Bash`) | `system/hooks/block-bare-ssh.py` | Denies bare `ssh`/`scp`/`rsync` to hosts in `config/hooks.json` `bare_ssh_hosts` (default none) and points at `ssh_wrapper`. |
| `PreToolUse` (`Bash`) | `system/hooks/block-heavy-build.py` | Opt-in (`"heavy_build_block": true` in `config/hooks.json`): denies tsc, next/webpack/vite builds, `npm ci`, bare installs. |
| `Stop` | `system/hooks/stop-deferred-work.py` | Catches "I'll do that shortly"-style deferrals in the final reply and forces the turn to continue, capped at 2 extensions. |

The `hooks` section of `claude-settings.json` is generated by
`bin/hooks-sync.py` from `config/hooks.json` on every boot (and by `setup.sh`).
Entries whose command is under `system/hooks/` are managed; hooks you add
yourself, `permissions` and `env` are preserved.

The git pre-commit also runs `system/check-secrets.py --staged`: forbidden
paths (`.env*` except `.env.template`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `id_*`, `secrets/`)
and a content scan (gitleaks if installed, else built-in regexes). Allow a
false positive by adding the exact line to `config/secrets-allow.txt`;
`KARAKOS_SECRET_SCAN=off` skips the content scan for one commit.

All hook scripts are fail-safe by construction: a parse error, a missing
field, or an unexpected shape is swallowed and the tool call / turn
proceeds exactly as it would unmodified. None of them ever raise into the
CLI.

### Recall re-injection (`inject-recall.py`)

Without this hook, a long-running session answers every question from
whatever was true when it started. `inject-recall.py` runs on every
`UserPromptSubmit` and folds a recall block into the turn via Claude Code's
`hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`. It is the only per-prompt recall path.

**Default source: the knowledge graph.** With no override, the hook queries
`data/memory/graph.db` with the prompt text and renders up to
`KARAKOS_RECALL_LIMIT` (default 6) `- [kind] subject: text` lines under
`[ACTIVE RECALL]`, capped at `KARAKOS_RECALL_MAX_CHARS` (default 2400). An
uninitialised or unreadable graph, any error, or a timeout
(`KARAKOS_RECALL_TIMEOUT_S`, default 10s) yields no block and never blocks the
turn. The hook is a fresh process per prompt, so it runs in **fast mode** (no
embedding model; keyword, name and importance signals). Set
`KARAKOS_RECALL_HOOK_MODE=full` to try the model within a 6 s budget, falling
back to fast.

**Operator override.** If `KARAKOS_RECALL_SOURCE` is set, or
`$WORKSPACE_ROOT/config/recall-source` exists, that source is used *instead of*
the graph, never alongside it:

- **Path does not exist** — no-op, not an error.
- **Path is executable** — run with the pending user prompt text on stdin;
  its stdout becomes the recall block. A non-zero exit, a crash, or a
  timeout are all treated as "no recall available."
- **Path is a plain file** — read verbatim, every turn, as a static recall
  block (e.g. a hand-maintained facts file).

Facts also load once per spawn (top graph facts by importance, own header),
because automated turns skip this hook; see ARCHITECTURE.md, "Memory".

Automated traffic — system pokes, heartbeats, and task-complete
notifications sent through `bin/poke.sh` (always `is_bot=1`) — skips
recall entirely, so scheduled/background turns don't pay for it.
`bin/agent-server.py` stamps a `[KARAKOS_AUTOMATED]` sentinel onto the
front of any message batch where every message is bot-originated; the hook
recognizes that same literal string as its skip gate. A batch with even
one human message alongside automated ones is left unmarked, so a human
reply riding along in the same batch still gets a fresh recall block.

### Tool permissions (`permissions.allow` / `permissions.deny`)

`bin/agent-server.py` passes `--dangerously-skip-permissions` on every
agent spawn, which is the CLI's own bypass-all-approval-prompts mode.
`permissions.allow` / `permissions.deny` in `config/claude-settings.json`
sit above that and are **not** overridden by it — verified against the
real CLI:

- A tool named in `permissions.deny` in full (e.g. `"WebFetch"`) is dropped
  from the session's tool list entirely at spawn. The model cannot call it
  — there is nothing to invoke, and no runtime prompt for
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to bypass.
- A fine-grained rule (e.g. `"Bash(curl:*)"`) leaves the tool available but
  declines a matching call at request time. That decline shows up in the
  stream-json `result` event's `permission_denials` list, which
  `read_agent_response()` logs as a warning
  (`<agent> permission denied: tool=... input=...`).
- `read_agent_response()` also logs the resolved tool list from the
  session's opening `system`/`init` event, so a full-tool deny is visible
  in `logs/agent-server.log` even though it never produces a runtime
  denial event.

Both `allow` and `deny` default to `[]` (no-op) and apply to every agent,
since `config/claude-settings.json` is currently one file shared across
all agents — there is no per-agent settings file.

### Per-agent environment

`config/claude-settings.json`'s own `env` key is applied by the CLI to its
own process environment, but since that file is shared, it's install-wide,
not per-agent. For environment scoped to a single agent, add an `env`
object to that agent's entry in `config/agents.yaml`:

```yaml
agents:
  helper:
    name: helper
    role: custom
    env:
      ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL: claude-haiku-4-5
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${GITHUB_TOKEN}
```

A subprocess's environment is built from nothing (`lib/spawn_env.py`): an
allowlist of inert names from the server (`PATH`, `HOME`, locale, proxy and CA
settings, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`,
`LC_*`, `XDG_*`), then this agent's `env:`, then the server's own identity
variables. `${NAME}` as a whole value is resolved from the server environment at
spawn; an unset name logs a warning and the key is left out. Hooks, MCP servers
and shell commands the agent runs inherit exactly this, so a skill that reads a
token must have the agent's `env:` name it. `KARAKOS_ENV_PASSTHROUGH=1` restores
the old inherit-everything behaviour for debugging and is refused when
`KARAKOS_ENV=production`. `AGENT_SERVER_TOKEN` is the one secret that is still
passed to every agent subprocess (see
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#credentials)). A skill author's rule of thumb:
document the variables your tool reads so operators can add them.

### Mid-turn tool activity lines

While a turn is running, the agent posts a subtext line naming each tool
call and what it is working on:

```
-# ⚙ Bash — npm test
-# ⚙ Read — /srv/app/main.py
```

This exists so a four-minute turn is distinguishable from a hung one — the
typing indicator alone cannot tell you the difference. **It is on by
default.** To silence it for an agent, set `tool_streaming` in that agent's
`config/agents.yaml` entry:

```yaml
agents:
  helper:
    name: helper
    role: custom
    system_prompt: agents/helper/SYSTEM_PROMPT.md
    tool_streaming: false
```

The lines are throttled, and the throttle is what makes on-by-default safe:
the first tool call of a turn always posts, then at most one line every
`TOOL_EVENT_MIN_INTERVAL` seconds, with a hard ceiling of
`TOOL_EVENT_MAX_PER_TURN` lines per turn (both in `bin/agent-server.py`). A
turn making fifty rapid tool calls posts one line, not fifty. These are a
liveness signal rather than an audit log — for a complete record of tool
calls, read the agent's log or the `tool_calls` table in
`data/mcp-tools-audit.db`.

Only a known argument is shown (`command`, `file_path`, `pattern`, `url`,
and a few more); an unrecognised tool gets its bare name. Tool inputs carry
file contents, patch bodies and credentials, and this line goes to a Discord
channel, so the summary is an allow-list rather than a best-effort dump.

Agents running with `channel_id` `"0"` (the local/headless lane) post
nothing, as with every other Discord surface.

## Shards

A shard is one `claude` subprocess of an agent. An agent with no `shards:` key
has one shard whose id **equals the agent id**, which is why history, queue rows
and sessions from before shards existed carry over unchanged. To add a shard,
list shards explicitly and keep the first one's id the agent's id:

```yaml
agents:
  main:
    name: Main
    role: primary
    shards:
      - id: main
        channels: [general]
      - id: main-ops
        channels: [ops]
```

- Shard ids match `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,31}$`, are unique across the registry and
  may not equal another agent's id. Channels are names from `config/channels.json`;
  **a channel belongs to at most one shard** (the registry refuses the file
  otherwise), and the relay routes by that ownership
  ([Routing](#routing)).
- Optional per-shard prompt text lives in `agents/<id>/shards/<shard-id>.md`
  (`agents/templates/shard.md` is a starting point). Sibling shards share the
  agent's memory graph and files.
- Apply with `POST /agents/<id>/reload` (or `/reload`); the relay re-reads the
  registry, so it needs no restart.
- **Every piece of per-conversation runtime state is keyed by shard id**: queue
  rows, sessions, cost rows, states, locks, pauses, handoff notes. Account-level
  facts (the rate-limit breaker) are not keyed by shard or agent.

**Memory per process.** Each shard is a separate `claude` process, so memory
grows with shard count. There is no figure to quote: measure your own. `docker
stats` shows the container's total; the image has no `ps`, so per-process
resident memory comes from `/proc` inside it:

```bash
docker stats --no-stream
docker compose -f config/docker-compose.yml --env-file config/.env exec karakos bash -c 'for d in /proc/[0-9]*; do c=$(tr "\0" " " < $d/cmdline); case "$c" in *[c]laude*) echo "${d#/proc/} $(grep VmRSS $d/status) ${c:0:60}";; esac; done'
```

Each line is one `claude` process: its pid, its resident memory (`VmRSS`, in
kB) and the start of its command line.

## The hive

Shards talk to each other through two MCP tools (`mcp/tools-server.py`):

- **`buzz`**: leave a message for another shard (an agent id or a shard id) and
  carry on; the recipient handles it as an ordinary turn and no result comes
  back. At most five per turn.
- **`hive_call`**: ask a shard a question and block the turn until the answer
  arrives. Use it only when you cannot continue without the answer.

Limits live in `lib/hive.py`: calls nest at most **two deep** (`HIVE_MAX_DEPTH`);
a shard cannot call itself or a shard already waiting on it; the default timeout
is 120 s, clamped to 5 to 900 s; a call that is never picked up expires and the
caller gets an `expired` reply; a paused callee returns `callee_paused`. The
HTTP side is `POST /hive/buzz`, `POST /hive/call`, `GET /hive/call/{call_id}`,
`POST /hive/call/{call_id}/cancel`. **The call log** is `GET /hive/calls`
([hive-call-log.md](hive-call-log.md)).

Two per-agent settings in `config/agents.yaml` shape throughput:

```yaml
agents:
  main:
    work_stealing: {enabled: false, after_s: 5, max_rows: 5}   # idle shards take rows waiting behind a busy sibling
    steering: {enabled: true, coalesce_ms: 300, max_lines_per_turn: 8}  # messages that arrive mid-turn are written to the running turn
```

## Memory

Durable memory is the knowledge graph (`data/memory/graph.db`, code in
`lib/graph`); [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md#memory) describes the store.
Agents use two MCP tools:

- **`memory`**: `write` (a fact, episode or pattern, optionally about a named
  subject), `recall` (ranked search with one hop of linked entities; modes
  `auto`, `keyword`, `recent`) and `status`. The older `remember`, `facts` and
  `recent` actions remain as deprecated aliases.
- **`graph`**: read and write entities and edges directly.

A nightly consolidation job (`lib/monitor_jobs/memory_consolidate.py`; run by
hand with `bin/graph-consolidate.py --dry-run`) builds episodes from the day's
messages, decays and archives them, merges duplicates and backfills embeddings.

**The recall override.** `config/recall-source` (or `KARAKOS_RECALL_SOURCE`)
**replaces** the graph recall in the per-prompt hook; it does not add to it. A
source written against 1.x that read `memory.db` finds nothing on 2.0.

## Prompts

An agent's system prompt is composed (`lib/prompt_compose.py`) from, in order:
the shared core (`agents/CORE.md`), the agent section
(`agents/<id>/SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`), optional shard text, and the fleet house style
(`agents/HOUSE_STYLE.md`) last. Registry control, per agent:

```yaml
agents:
  main:
    prompt:
      section: agents/main/SYSTEM_PROMPT.md
      core: true
      house_style: true
```

If the section holds a line `<!-- core:insert -->`, the core is spliced there
instead of at the top. Generated blocks are wrapped in
`<!-- begin:core -->` / `<!-- end:core -->` and the `house-style` equivalent;
they are stripped before composing, so composing twice is idempotent.
Placeholders (`{{AGENT_NAME}}`, `{{SYSTEM_NAME}}`, `{{OWNER_NAME}}`,
`{{CHANNELS}}`, `{{OTHER_AGENTS}}`, `{{SHARD_ID}}`) are filled at compose time.

- **Renaming a display name** (`name:`) is a manual edit of `config/agents.yaml`
  followed by a session reset. **An agent id cannot be renamed**: it keys every
  row.
- **Adopting the 2.0 templates** (`agents/templates/primary.md`, `monitor.md`) on
  an upgraded install is opt-in: copy the template, point `prompt.section` at
  it, and, for the monitor, accept that its prompt, tool deny list and limits
  come with it. An existing monitor keeps its own prompt until you do.
- **The reset rule.** A resumed session ignores a changed system prompt. After
  editing a prompt, `/reset` the agent (`reload` keeps the old one).

## Build queue

`config/build-queue.yaml` is off by default (`enabled: false`): briefs dropped in
`inbox/builder/` and `inbox/reviewer/` are then run directly. With `enabled:
true` they are queued, with priority, per-host concurrency, an admission probe,
cancel and a bounded retry; `bin/buildq` is the operator CLI. Keys:
`default_host`, `hosts` (each `kind: local|ssh`, `concurrency`, `target`,
`workdir`, `probe`, `min_free_ram_mb`, `max_load1`, `repo_url`), `roles`,
`cost_ceiling_usd` (applies to ssh runs only), `retry`, `governor`,
`unreachable_grace_s`. Host names, ssh targets and probe commands come only from
this file, never from a brief.

**Provisioning a remote build host.** The dispatcher pipes `bin/build-runner.sh`
to the host over ssh. The host needs `bash`, `git`, the `claude` CLI and, for
builds, `gh`, installed for the ssh user, and an ssh alias or destination that
works non-interactively. **Credentials are the remote's own; none are
forwarded**: `git` and `gh` use whatever the remote user is logged in with.

## What survives an upgrade

These are the seams that stay yours across image upgrades:

| Seam | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `config/agents.yaml` | The registry warns on unknown keys instead of failing |
| `prompt:` per agent | Your section file stays; core and house style are flags |
| `config/hooks.json` | `bin/hooks-sync.py` rebuilds only the hooks under `system/hooks/`; hooks you added to `config/claude-settings.json` are preserved |
| `skills/` | Discovered at startup; yours are untouched |
| `config/channels.json` | Keys you add (`route`, `ux`, `reply_gate`, ...) are read when present and ignored when not |
| `config/monitor.yaml`, `config/governor.yaml`, `config/build-queue.yaml` | Optional files with built-in defaults when absent; the migrator creates `build-queue.yaml` only when it is missing and never overwrites it |

The [stability contract](#release20-stability-contract) says what else is stable.

**Queue database reads.** `data/memory/agent-server.db` is in rollback-journal
mode, so a read cursor left open across an `await` blocks every writer. In code
that touches the queue, read with one-hop `await db.execute_fetchall(...)` and
write with `msgqueue.write_commit(...)`; never `async with db.execute(...)`
followed by `fetchone()` across awaits, and never hold an unexhausted cursor.

## Native deployments (not supported, lessons)

Docker plus supervisord is the supported deployment. A native one has to supply
what the container supplies. The lessons:

1. **Order units with `Wants=` plus `After=`, never `BindsTo=`.** `BindsTo=`
   stops the dependent unit whenever the dependency stops or restarts, so
   restarting the agent server takes the relay and scheduler down with it and a
   failed start cascades. `Wants=` plus `After=` starts them in order and lets
   each survive the other's restart and reconnect.
2. **Run as a non-root user.** The CLI refuses `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
   as root.
3. **Set `PATH` or the CLI path explicitly.** systemd's `PATH` does not include
   the directory the CLI installs to; put it in the unit or an `EnvironmentFile`.
4. **Handle exit 78.** The schema-stamp guard exits 78 and a restart loop cannot
   fix it: add `RestartPreventExitStatus=78` and run
   `python3 lib/migrate/guard.py check data` in `ExecStartPre=`.
5. **Give `TimeoutStopSec` at least the compose `stop_grace_period` (45 s)** so
   agents finalize sessions.
6. **Use `KillMode=control-group`** so tool processes an agent started die with
   the service. Never restart by pattern-matching `claude` with `pkill`: it kills
   every agent's process. Stop the unit.
7. **Set `WORKSPACE_ROOT` and the working directory explicitly.**

An example, not shipped as files; paths and user are placeholders:

```text
# /etc/systemd/system/karakos-agent-server.service
[Unit]
Description=Karakos agent server
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=karakos
WorkingDirectory=/opt/karakos
Environment=WORKSPACE_ROOT=/opt/karakos
EnvironmentFile=/opt/karakos/config/.env
Environment=PATH=/opt/karakos/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/python3 /opt/karakos/lib/migrate/guard.py check /opt/karakos/data
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /opt/karakos/bin/agent-server.py
Restart=on-failure
RestartPreventExitStatus=78
TimeoutStopSec=45
KillMode=control-group

# /etc/systemd/system/karakos-relay.service  (the scheduler is the same shape)
[Unit]
Description=Karakos relay

After=karakos-agent-server.service

[Service]
User=karakos

ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /opt/karakos/bin/relay.py
Restart=on-failure

KillMode=control-group
```

## Review checklist

Every release/2.0 PR is reviewed against this list. Each item is yes/no; any
"no" on items 1 to 4 is a high finding.

1. Runtime state is keyed by shard id.
2. No data is mutated at boot; every schema change is a `lib/migrate/steps/` step.
3. No household identifiers: `system/check-coupling.sh` prints `coupling: clean`.
4. The tests named in the spec exist and run.
5. Old-install behaviour is unchanged where the spec says so.
6. No new dependency without a pin.

`system/check-coupling.sh` scans git-tracked files against
`system/coupling-denylist.txt` (tab-separated `name`, `regex`, optional
`path-regex`, optional `line-regex`) and honours `system/coupling-allow.txt`
(`path-glob<TAB>regex`). Forks add their own hostnames and names to the
denylist locally. To run it before every push:
`system/install-hooks.sh --install-pre-push` (off by default).

## release/2.0 stability contract

For downstream forks tracking `release/2.0`:

- **Churn expected:** `bin/agent-server.py`, `bin/relay.py`, the `config/`
  layout, `setup.sh`, the `dashboard/` source.
- **Stable:** the `/message` and `/agents` HTTP shapes, `config/channels.json`,
  hook file names, MCP tool names.
- Small portable fixes submitted by forks are welcome on `release/2.0` now;
  landing them early lets forks rebase once.

## lib/migrate (schema stamp and migrator)

`data/.schema-version` (`{"schema": 2, "package": "2.0.0", "migrated_from": ..., "stamped_at": ...}`)
marks a data directory as 2.0. `bin/entrypoint.sh` and `bin/agent-server.py`
call `lib/migrate/guard.py: require_stamp` before touching any data and exit
78 on an unstamped non-empty directory or an older schema. An empty or absent
data directory is a fresh install and is stamped (`guard.py stamp --fresh`).
`KARAKOS_SKIP_STAMP_CHECK=1` bypasses the check for tests only and is refused
when `KARAKOS_ENV=production`.

**Boot code may only check the stamp, never alter data.** The migrator
(`python3 -m lib.migrate [--dry-run|--auto|--force|--backup-to DIR|--to-backup DIR]`, wrapper
`bin/karakos-migrate`; the host command is `bin/karakos migrate`) is the only writer of 1.x data. It detects the version
(read-only fingerprints, `detect.py`), takes a backup (`backup.py`, sqlite
online backup plus a hashed `MANIFEST.json`), runs each applicable step in
`lib/migrate/steps/NN_name.py` order, verifies each, and writes the stamp last.
A failed step leaves the stamp absent and prints the backup path and restore
command. Exit codes: 0 ok, 1 step failed, 2 usage, 3 refused (unknown schema,
no `--force`), 78 guard.

A step module exposes `STEP = Step(name, from_schema, to_schema, detect, apply, verify)`.

Contributor rules: runtime state is keyed by shard id, and **only
`lib/migrate/steps/` mutates existing data**; boot may check the stamp and create
files that did not exist.

| Step | Owns |
|------|------|
| `05_layout` | compose file and `.env` rewrite (originals kept as `.pre-2.0`), `logs/` and `inbox/` import |
| `10_registry` | config: `agents.json` to `agents.yaml`, prompt flags, hooks sync |
| `12_monitor` | the default monitor's 2.0 template |
| `20_queue` | queue schema |
| `30_sessions` | sessions schema |
| `35_rate_limit` | rate-limit table re-keyed by window type |
| `40_memory` | `memory.db` to `graph.db` (the only code that opens `memory.db`) |
| `50_build_queue` | build queue database and config |
| `60_outbox` | dead-letter file to outbox `dead` rows |
| `90_stamp` | integrity check before the runner writes the stamp |
